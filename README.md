Homework for 30.11.2020

My variant:  7
My task was to create class "Musician", which would contain fields for description artist or band. For example: name, fee, age and etc. Add class "MusicFestival" which would have maximal budget and recruitment of artists. Realize  constructor, which would get massive of musicians and check if summar fee doesn’t exceed and add only those artists, which can afford. And realize methods of adding, removing artists.

To run the program you should open it through Visual Studio (or any another IDE, it’s up to you). You can add artist through Musician class, having entered name, fee and age of artist. To add artists to MusicFestival you can use either constructor or "addMusician()" method. Accordingly, remove artists with "removeMusician()". Now you are ready to run the program. It will ask you maximal festival budget and check which artist we can afford and which we don’t.
